% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement

%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of

% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors

% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.

% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names

\begin{abstract}
Documenting software in a way that avoids verbosity, ambiguity, and confusion is a goal that all software architects should aspire to. The authors will identify and compare several formats that may be used to document software. The authors will list some of the pros and cons of each format, helping the readers to make an informed choice of the format to use for their own software projects.

\section{Introduction}



\section{Background}
Software architects are responsible for communicating ideas from stakeholders to software coders with the goal that the software coders accurately and completely implement those ideas into a working software product.\newline
With an estimated software project failure rate of over 40\%, we need to investigate possible reasons for such a high percentage of failures. One such reason may be a failure to communicate effectively. Communication is required between stakeholders and requirements engineers, between requirements engineers and software architects, and finally between software architects and software coders and testers \cite{Lamport:RequirementsEngineering}. The authors will focus their investigation on communication failures between software architects and software coders and testers. This approach will assume that documents created prior to this communication phase are both complete and correct.\newline
Software architects have several formats to chose from when it comes to creating documentation for software. We will assume that most software projects are too complex to support an all oral format using natural language to communicate the ideas, so we will assume that at least a written format using natural language is required. Other formats that are more formal and structured in nature include UML diagrams and mathematical models.

\section{Related Work}
Miles and Hamilton describe why and how to use UML (Universal Modeling Language) for documenting software. They state that because informal languages do not have exact rules they will always suffer from the problem of verbosity, confusion, ambiguity and unnecessary details, which is an extremely dangerous way to model a system. Their solution is to use a formal modeling language, such as UML \cite{Lamport:UML}.
\newline
They list the following situations for using UML \cite{Lamport:UML}.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Requirements using Use Case Diagrams
	\newline
	Use cases are the system's functional requirements and should be the first output from your modeling. "How can you begin to design a system if you don't know what it will be required to do?" \cite{Lamport:UML} Use cases specify what the system will deliver to users.
	\newline
	The figure below shows a sample use case diagram from our class project.
	\newline
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{UseCaseDiagrams}
	\item System Workflows using Activity Diagrams
	\newline
	Activity diagrams show how the system will accomplish the requirements set out in the user case diagrams. High-level actions are linked together to represent a process that needs to occur in the system \cite{Lamport:UML}.
	\newline
	The figure below shows a sample activity diagram from our class project.
	\newline
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{ActivityDiagram}
	\item A Systems Logical Structure using Class Diagrams
	\newline
	Class diagrams show classes and their relationships \cite{Lamport:UML}.
	\newline
	The figure below shows a sample class diagram from our class project.
	\newline
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{ClassDiagrams}
	\item Ordered Interactions using Sequence Diagrams
	\newline
	Sequence diagrams are an important member of a group known as interaction diagrams. They help accurately model how the parts that make up the system interact.  They capture the order of interactions between parts of the system, describe which interactions will be triggered and in what order those interactions will occur.
	\newline
	The figure below shows a sample class diagram from our class project.
	\newline
	\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{SequenceDiagram}
	\item Interaction Links using Communication Diagrams
	\item Interaction Timing using Timing Diagrams
	\item Interaction Picture using Interaction Overview Diagrams
	\item Internal Class Structure using Composite Structures
	\item System Parts using Component Diagrams
	\item Organize Your Model using Packages
	\item Object State using State Machine Diagrams
	\item The Deployed System using Deployment Diagrams
\end{enumerate}
Wiegers and Beatty discuss the importance of using both textual and visual formats to capture the full intentions of the intended system. Their book describes the following visual requirements models \cite{Lamport:SoftwareRequirements}.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Data flow diagrams (DFDs)
	\item Process flow diagrams 
	\item State-transition diagrams and state tables
	\item Dialog maps
	\item Decision tables and decision trees
	\item Event-response tables
	\item Feature trees (Ch 5)
	\item Use case diagrams (Ch 8)
	\item Activity diagrams (Ch 8)
	\item Entity-relationship diagrams (Ch 13)
\end{enumerate}
Wiegers and Beatty also briefly discuss the use of visual models in agile driven projects \cite{Lamport:SoftwareRequirements}.

The American Institute of Architects discuss the need for standard content and graphics to be used by Construction Architects to document their projects (Appendix E). \cite{Lamport:AIA_Graphical_Standards}. Although software architecture and construction architecture are technically different fields, they share many common goals of turning stakeholder ideas into a real products.
\newline
The US CAD Standard (NCS) is a compilation of related documents published by several organizations for the purposes of creating a national standard for construction related CAD documents. \cite{Lamport:AIA_Graphical_Standards}.\newline
A national design document standard provides the following advantages
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Allows information to be transfered throughout the project cycle from one professional to another.
	\item Results in better coordination between architects and engineers
	\item Saves production time
	\item Improves the overall design of the project
\end{enumerate}
The Uniform Drawing System consist of 8 modules that help standardize the documents needed to convey information from the architect to the builder \cite{Lamport:AIA_Graphical_Standards}.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Module 1 - Drawing Set Organization
	\item Module 2 - Sheet Organization
	\item Module 3 - Schedules
	\item Module 4 - Drafting Conventions
	\item Module 5 - Terms and Abbreviations
	\item Module 6 - Symbols
	\item Module 7 - Notations
	\item Module 8 - Code Conventions
\end{enumerate}

Of particular interest is the use of a drawing set hierarchy 

Ingeno discusses methods for documenting and reviewing software architectures \cite{Lamport:SoftwareArchitectureHandbook} In particular, he discusses
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Uses of software architecture documentation
	\item Creating architecture descriptions (ADs), including architecture views
	\item Using UML to document software architecture
	\item Reviewing software architecture documents
\end{enumerate}

\section{Proposed Approach}
The authors will review some of the literature written by leading experts on the topic of requirements documentation content and format. A table will be generated listing the different formats proposed and the pros and cons of each format.

	\item Understanding Research Problems
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Topic: We are evaluating the usefulness of presenting ideas in different formats 
		\item Question: because we want to find out if certain formats are more useful than others in communicating ideas from stakeholders to software developers
		\item Significance: so that we can help others choose a document format that will result in successful communication of ideas from stakeholders to software developers.
